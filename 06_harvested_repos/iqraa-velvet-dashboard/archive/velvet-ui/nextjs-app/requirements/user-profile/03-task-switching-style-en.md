## 03 — Task Switching Style

This file explains how the researcher transitions between tasks,  
manages attention, and distributes cognitive load inside the Iqraa platform.

---

## **1. General Cognitive Switching Pattern**
The researcher:

- Dislikes rapid task jumping  
- Prefers orderly transitions  
- Treats each task as an independent track  
- Requires context before movement  
- Views the interface as a map, not a list  

---

## **2. Natural Work Tendencies**
The researcher tends to:

- Complete a thought before starting another  
- Return to the main frame when distracted  
- Use a Stable Layer during intensive work  
- Avoid forced tasks and auto-switching  
- Strongly dislike cognitive interruptions  

---

## **3. Handling Multi-Tasking**
When tasks multiply, the researcher:

- Breaks work into phases  
- Distributes load across layers  
- Uses lenses to return to track  
- Needs a continuous cognitive thread  
- Benefits from an “Active Task” marker  

Multi-tasking is not tiring—if structured.

---

## **4. Cognitive Fatigue Points**
Task switching becomes exhausting when:

- A new track is forced before completing the current one  
- Multiple windows open without a map  
- Information flows too quickly  
- The anchor point is lost  
- Context changes unexpectedly  

---

## **5. Smooth Switching Conditions**
Switching becomes smooth when:

- Layers are clear  
- A cognitive map is available  
- Lenses illustrate structure  
- “Continue Later” markers exist  
- Visual connection between tracks is maintained  

---

## **6. UI Impact**
The UI must provide:

- A stable primary layer  
- Sub-track creation  
- A mini knowledge map  
- Lenses for context return  
- An “Active Task” marker  
- Protection against random jumps  

---

## **Conclusion**
The researcher’s switching pattern is **structural, layered, and context-dependent**,  
and must be fully supported by the Velvet Dashboard.
