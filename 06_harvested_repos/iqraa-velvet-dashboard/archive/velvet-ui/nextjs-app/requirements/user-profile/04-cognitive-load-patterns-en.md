## 04 — Cognitive Load Patterns

This file describes how the researcher processes information,  
and how cognitive load rises, stabilizes, and collapses during work.

---

## **1. The Researcher’s Cognitive Load Curve**
The researcher shows a distinctive pattern:

- Starts with low load  
- Rises gradually  
- Stabilizes at mid-high load  
- Collapses suddenly rather than slowly  

This requires deliberate “cognitive ventilation points” in the UI.

---

## **2. Load Amplifiers**
Cognitive load increases sharply when:

- Too many elements appear on screen  
- The track is lost  
- No structural hierarchy exists  
- Information flows too quickly  
- Multiple parallel tasks stack without layers  

---

## **3. Load Reducers**
Cognitive load decreases when:

- Only one clear working layer is present  
- Elements per screen are minimal  
- Expand-collapse options exist  
- A cognitive map is visible  
- Lenses clarify relationships  
- Stepwise design is used  

---

## **4. Information Processing Sequence**
The researcher naturally handles information in this order:

1. **Gathering**  
2. **Structuring**  
3. **Linking**  
4. **Constructing**  
5. **Executing**  

This sequential logic defines the UI architecture.

## **5. Cognitive Fatigue Signals**
Fatigue appears when:

- Focus collapses suddenly  
- The researcher feels “lost”  
- A need to restart the track emerges  
- Decision-making slows down  
- Everything must be closed to reset  

---

## **6. Cognitive Stability Signals**
The researcher becomes highly productive when:

- Screens are tidy  
- Tracks are visible  
- Load is spread across layers  
- A continuous mental thread exists  
- Transitions follow logical hierarchy  

---

## **7. UI Design Implications**
This file drives several UI decisions:

- A stable primary work layer  
- Load distributed across sub-interfaces  
- Stepwise flows instead of stacking  
- Meaningful button design  
- Reduced cognitive clutter  
- Fewer random popups  

---

## **Conclusion**
The researcher’s cognitive load is **structured, rhythmic, and pattern-driven**,  
and the UI must respect this neurological architecture.
