## 02 — Preferences & Cognitive Triggers

This file analyzes the researcher’s cognitive preferences and the mental triggers  
that activate deep-focus work, as well as the elements that disrupt mental flow.

---

## **1. Core Cognitive Preferences**
The researcher prefers:

- Dark, immersive environments  
- Clear cards rather than complex windows  
- Clean displays with minimal distraction  
- Wide analytical spaces  
- Soft transitions and gentle motion  
- Simple, non-noisy interface language  

These preferences define the “Velvet Identity” of the dashboard.

---

## **2. Cognitive Triggers**
The researcher enters a high-focus state when encountering:

- A stimulating question  
- Raw data ready for analysis  
- A visible pattern or relationship  
- A problem worth breaking down  
- A complex text  
- The opportunity to generate a new idea  

These triggers elevate cognitive engagement and initiate deep reasoning.

---

## **3. Flow Disruptors**
The researcher’s mental rhythm is disrupted by:

- Rapid screen switching  
- Visual noise  
- Parallel task overload  
- Unresolved decisions  
- Unstructured data  
- Excessive alerts or warnings  

Thus, the UI must maintain:

- Soft pacing  
- Quiet movement  
- Controlled information density  

---

## **4. Focus Enhancers**
Factors that reinforce deep focus include:

- Stable screens with preserved context  
- A clear cognitive thread through the workflow  
- Lenses that reveal conceptual structure  
- Layered spaces allowing controlled movement  
- Manual control over progression  
- Absence of time pressure in the interface  

---

## **5. UI Impact**
Because of this profile, the UI must provide:

- A “Start Thinking” button derived from triggers  
- Calm, clear workflow tracks  
- A minimalistic first screen  
- Layered meaning-revealing surfaces  
- Avoidance of flow-breaking elements  
- A card-and-lens-based visual logic  

These elements shape the **Session Start Zone** of the Velvet Dashboard.
