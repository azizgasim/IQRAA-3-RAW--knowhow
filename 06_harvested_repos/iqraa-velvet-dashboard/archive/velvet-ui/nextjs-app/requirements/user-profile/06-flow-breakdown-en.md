## 06 — Cognitive Flow Breakdown

This file analyzes the full mental progression of the researcher  
throughout a complete analytical session in the Iqraa Platform.  
It is used to convert cognitive flow into UI/UX operational logic.

---

## **1. The Initial Spark**
A session begins when:

- An idea appears  
- A question emerges  
- A pattern is noticed  
- A problem becomes visible  

The UI must provide:

- A clear entry point  
- A minimal starting screen  
- Obvious primary keys  
- No visual noise  

---

## **2. Early Exploration**
The researcher begins:

- Browsing materials  
- Observing relationships  
- Identifying components  
- Determining direction  

The UI should support this with:

- Calm pacing  
- Organized displays  
- Self-explanatory cards  
- Soft transitions  

---

## **3. Path Locking**
Once the right direction is found, the researcher:

- Locks onto a track  
- Selects the lens or perspective  
- Defines methodology  
- Stabilizes context  

The UI should provide:

- A stable main layer  
- Lenses for verification  
- A mini cognitive map  
- A “Current Track” indicator  

---

## **4. Deepening Stage**
The researcher enters conceptual depth:

- Pattern extraction  
- Relationship analysis  
- Close reading  
- Framework construction  

The UI must:

- Remove noise  
- Expand workspace  
- Provide analytical lenses  
- Offer meaning-building tools  

---

## **5. Generative Stage**
The researcher begins creating:

- Results  
- Concepts  
- Models  
- Written outputs  

The UI must provide:

- Production tools  
- Structuring tools  
- Editable cards  
- Knowledge units  

---

## **6. Decision Crystallization**
The researcher now:

- Compares  
- Evaluates  
- Weighs options  
- Forms recommendations  

The UI must provide:

- Comparison tools  
- Soft gold indicators  
- Supportive layers  

---

## **7. Cognitive Cooldown**
After intense work, the researcher experiences:

- Sudden cognitive slowdown  
- Need to pause  
- Need to archive  
- Need to close the track  

Thus the UI must include:

- Clear export tools  
- A “Close Session” action  
- A low-density cooldown surface  

---

## **8. Resolution**
A session ends when the researcher:

- Saves outputs  
- Archives results  
- Finalizes the project  
- Prepares for the next cycle  

This flow becomes the **operational backbone of the Velvet Dashboard**.
