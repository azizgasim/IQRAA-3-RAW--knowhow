## 03 — Capability Framework: The Intelligent Processor Model

The Iqraa platform operates according to the **Intelligent Multilayer Processor** framework,  
which distributes capabilities across four fundamental cognitive engines:

1. **Primary Processing**  
   Fast intake, summarization, filtering, extraction.

2. **Concept Modeling**  
   Turning raw information into structured concepts and frameworks.

3. **Decision Execution**  
   Comparative reasoning, prioritization, option evaluation.

4. **Interaction Expansion**  
   Exploring alternative pathways, perspectives, and cognitive lenses.

This model ensures that the platform behaves not as a “toolbox”  
but as an **intelligent cognitive companion** that extends the researcher’s mental capacity.
