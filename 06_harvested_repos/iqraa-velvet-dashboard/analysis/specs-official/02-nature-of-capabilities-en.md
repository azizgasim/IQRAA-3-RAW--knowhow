## 02 — The Nature of Capabilities

Capabilities inside the Iqraa platform are not merely functions or commands.  
They are **cognitive, behavioral, and structural layers** that operate across multiple levels of reasoning.

### Capabilities include:
- Knowledge collection  
- Conceptual analysis  
- Relationship extraction  
- Model-building  
- Memory formation  
- Decision support  
- Structural interpretation  

Each capability functions as a **mental engine** that helps reshape information into usable insight.  
Rather than acting as independent tools, capabilities work as **interconnected layers** supporting the researcher’s thinking.
