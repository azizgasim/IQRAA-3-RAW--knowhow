## 04 — Translating Capabilities into UI Architecture

The UI must represent capabilities visually in a way that preserves their cognitive meaning.

### Each capability becomes:
- A **Key** (functional entry point)  
- A **Card** (visualized output)  
- A **Module** (processing unit)  
- A **Track** (analytical or generative sequence)  
- A **Lens** (perspective-shifting tool)

### This translation ensures:
- A structured navigation system  
- A clear conceptual hierarchy  
- A unified cognitive language for the interface  
- A dashboard that reflects the mental architecture of the researcher  

Capabilities → Keys → Modules → Lenses → Dashboard Flow  

This chain forms the **UI Design Root** for Iqraa 12.
