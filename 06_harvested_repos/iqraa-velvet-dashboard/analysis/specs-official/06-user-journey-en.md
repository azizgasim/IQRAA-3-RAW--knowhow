## User Cognitive Journey Inside the "Iqraa" Platform

The researcher’s journey represents the mental path through which the user processes, evaluates, and constructs knowledge inside the platform.  
This journey is not based on “usage steps” but on **cognitive stages**, which form the foundation of the interface design.

---

## **1. Cognitive Trigger**
The moment the researcher initiates work, which includes:
- Asking a question  
- Observing a pattern  
- Encountering a problem  
- Seeking an entry point  
- Trying to understand a text  

This stage requires:
- A simple interface  
- Clear input space  
- Prominent primary buttons  
- Direct activation keys  

---

## **2. Path Discovery**
After the trigger moment, the researcher begins to:
- Determine the direction of inquiry  
- Select the type of processing  
- Decide whether they are searching, analyzing, or interpreting  
- Switch between capabilities  

This stage requires:
- A visually clear set of options  
- Well-organized primary keys  
- Explicit cognitive paths with low mental load  

---

## **3. Knowledge Intake**
At this point, the researcher:
- Inputs text  
- Uploads files  
- Adds URLs  
- Focuses on raw material  

This stage requires:
- A comfortable input interface  
- A clean and encouraging empty-state  
- Visual calmness to reduce distraction  

---

## **4. Primary Analysis**
Includes:
- Quick understanding  
- Summarization  
- Extracting key points  
- Filtering content  

This stage requires:
- Direct tools  
- Clean interface  
- Short options  
- Fast results  

---

## **5. Understanding Construction**
Includes:
- Concept formation  
- Relationship mapping  
- Reconstructing meaning  
- Switching between cognitive lenses  

This stage requires:
- Multi-layered interface  
- Lenses  
- Concept cards  
- Interpretive pathways  

---

## **6. Decision Formation**
The researcher now begins to:
- Differentiate  
- Compare  
- Extract decision paths  
- Analyze alternatives  

This stage requires:
- Comparison tools  
- Clear structural cards  
- Light cognitive surfaces  
- Smart visual guidance  

---

## **7. Synthesis**
Includes:
- Converting results into a product  
- Writing summaries  
- Producing reports  
- Formulating recommendations  

This stage requires:
- Editing tools  
- Export buttons  
- Knowledge-production workspaces  

---

## **8. External Interaction**
Finally, the researcher needs to:
- Export results  
- Share findings  
- Archive outcomes  
- Pass results to another agent  

This stage requires:
- Auxiliary toolbars  
- Minimalist actions  
- Explicit interaction keys (Export, Share, Integrate)  

---

## **Conclusion**
The researcher’s journey is not linear.  
It is a **cognitive curve** made of:
- Initiation  
- Construction  
- Expansion  
- Contraction  
- Re-organization  
- Production  

This journey is the mental blueprint upon which the “Velvet Dashboard” of Iqraa 12 will be designed.
