      <stage>A Page brings a seat, which is placed next to the throne, on its R., Cinderella occupies
        it, the sisters sit on her R. H., and the fête continues. A fanciful dance by appropriate
        characters, followed by a party of Tyrolese singers and dancers, who enter dressed in the
        costume of their nation. While some dance, the others accompany them by their voices
        alone.</stage>
